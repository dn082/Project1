# PROJECT 1

## INTRODUCTIONS
In this project, I chose to analyze tweets using the Sentiment140 dataset. My goal is to understand patterns in how the wording and or the way text is framed a certain way text can express sentiment on whether it can have positive or negative emotions.

My Research Questions
- Pattern Focused: What are the most common words and phrases in positive tweets versus negative tweets?
- Length of Message Focused: Does the length of a tweet correlate with its sentiment? Such as are shorter tweets more often positive or negative?
- Day of Time Trends Focused: Are there specific times or days when positive or negative tweets are more common? 

## THE DATASET
The data I chose to use is a file found from Kaggle called https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140. I chose this dataset because it has many columns, which gives me more ways of analyzing the data to answer my questions, as it contains 1.6 million tweets labeled for sentiment (positive or negative), along with other information such as timestamps.

## PREPROCESSING
Some steps I took for preprocessing my data were to:
- Remove Irrelevant Columns - Doing this step allowed me to use data that was relevant to answer my questions and focus on columns that will contribute to my analysis and visualizations.
- Cleaning Up Data of Text Data - This step allows the tweets to be cleaned and more readable, so I can focus on the text that will help answer my questions. Which included URLs, mentions, hashtags, special characters, etc.
- Renaming Columns - This allows the dataset to have better readability to understand not just the code but the dataset itself.
- Changing Text to Lowercase - This allowed the text not to differentiate the same word when doing frequency counts, along with it making it more readable.
- Adding Columns - This allowed me to describe and find something specific that will help me any my questions and so I can be able to work with that specific data.

## VISUALIZATION/DATA UNDERSTANDING
To explore the data, I plan to use
- Bar Charts: Ideal to show frequent words for positive and negative tweets.
- Box Plots: Allow to show tweet length for each sentiment, as well as the range and any outliers.
- Line Graph: to be used to plot the number of positive and negative tweets over time, such as by hour of the day, to show patterns of tweet amounts for that specific time.
