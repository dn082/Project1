# PROJECT 1

## INTRODUCTIONS
In this project, I chose to analyze tweets using the Sentiment140 dataset. My goal is to understand patterns in how the wording and or the way text is framed a certain way text can express sentiment on whether it can have positive or negative emotions.

My Research Questions
- Pattern Focused: What are the most common words and phrases in positive tweets versus negative tweets? Do certain words or hashtags strongly correlate with positive or negative sentiment?
- Length of Message Focused: Does the length of a tweet correlate with its sentiment? Such as are shorter tweets more often positive or negative?
- Day of Time Trends Focused: Are there specific times or days when positive or negative tweets are more common? 


## THE DATASET
The data I chose to use is a file found from Kaggle called https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140.  I mostly chose this dataset because it has many columns, which gives me more ways of analyzing the data to answer my questions, as it contains 1.6 million tweets labeled for sentiment (positive or negative), along with other information such as timestamps.

## PREPROCESSING
In this project, I will clean data by removing irrelevant columns, cleaning up the text by removing URLs, mentions, emojis, and special characters. I will also be renaming columns so it's clearer and understandable. I will also convert text to make the words lowercase for it to be readable both ways.



## VISUALIZATION/DATA UNDERSTANDING
To explore the data, I plan to use
- Bar Charts: Ideal to show frequent words for positive and negative tweets.
- Box Plots: Allow to show tweet length for each sentiment, as well as the range and any outliers.
- Line Graph: to be used to plot the number of positive and negative tweets over time, such as by hour of the day or day of the week, to show patterns



## NOTES
Project is in progress.
